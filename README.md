# SETAP_Project_Management

Due to the short timeframe, I was only able to complete a simple prototype of the project management app.

There’s several things that need to be improve upon from the prototype to the final application such as:
- Being able to enter tasks from scratch - removing the hardcoded template with tasks & a company name.
- More details for the tasks - adding a description / owner for who is supposed to be doing each task
- Making the tasks appended to the gantt chart editable after it’s been added
- Making the task table update when the gantt chart is edited
- Attach a database in a similar way to the system architecture above.
- Adding security, separate roles & a login for users.
- Improving the user interface to be more accessible & legible for all.
